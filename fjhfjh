<h1>ALCAZAR PRISON-AL CAPONE</h1>

<p1>Alphonse Gabriel Capone, was an American mobster, crime boss, and businessman who attained notoriety during the Prohibition era as the co-founder and boss of the Chicago Outfit, sometimes known by the nickname "Scarface".</p1> 
<p> FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE </p>
<p1>Al Capone was born in Brooklyn, New York, on January 17, 1899.. Far from being a poor immigrant from Italy who turned to crime to make a living, Capone was from a respectable, professional family. His father, Gabriele, was one of thousands of Italians who arrived in New York in 1894. He was 30 years old, educated and from Naples, where he had earned a living as a barber. His wife Teresa was pregnant and already bringing up two sons: 2-year-old son Vincenzo and infant son Raffaele.The young Capone family lived in a poor New York tenement, little more than a slum and far from salubrious, near the Brooklyn Navy Yard. It was a tough place given over to the vices sought by sailor characters that frequented the surrounding bars. </p1>
